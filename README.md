# Text-to-Image-Synthesis-using-DF-GAN
Text-to-Image Synthesis using DF-GAN | A deep learning project that generates high-resolution (256Ã—256) images from text descriptions using DF-GAN. Implements Deep Fusion Blocks (DFBlock) for enhanced semantic alignment and Matching-Aware Gradient Penalty (MA-GP) for improved realism, outperforming AttnGAN and StackGAN++ in FID and IS scores.
